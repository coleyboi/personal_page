        <h2>My Strongest Trait and Impact on Academics</h2>
        <p>
            My strongest trait is **empathy**. As an INFP, I am deeply in tune with the emotions of others and often find myself understanding and supporting those around me. In my academic life, this trait drives me to be compassionate towards my classmates, which makes group work and collaboration smooth. Empathy also helps me maintain perspective and resolve conflicts in a gentle, understanding way. However, it can sometimes lead to avoidance of conflict, which I am learning to manage by expressing my own needs more confidently.

        <h2>My Hero</h2>
        <p>
            Favorite Quote: "As we advance in life it becomes more and more difficult, but in fighting the difficulties the inmost strength of the heart is developed." â€” Vincent van Gogh
        </p>
        <p>
            My hero is Vincent van Gogh. His life and work inspire me deeply because, like him, I am guided by my inner world of emotions and creativity. He found beauty in life's challenges and turned his struggles into art that continues to resonate with people today. I admire his ability to push through personal difficulties and transform them into something meaningful. His passion for his craft reminds me to stay true to my values, no matter how hard things may get.

        <p>
            I took a personality test that identified me as an **INFP (Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Perceiving)**. This result makes sense to me because I am creative, empathetic, and driven by a desire to make meaningful connections and create harmony. I value authenticity and tend to approach life with an open mind, which guides my decision-making process in both academic and personal pursuits. While I sometimes struggle with practical matters and decision-making, I thrive in environments that allow me to express my values and creativity freely. Overall, I believe this test offers valid insights into my personality and the way I engage with the world.
