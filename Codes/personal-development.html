        <h2>Reflection on “Twelve Pillars”</h2>
        <p>
            After reading Chapters 4-7 of *Twelve Pillars* by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener, I realized how important it is to take personal responsibility for my success. Chapter 4, in particular, focuses on discipline and daily habits, which resonated with me because I’ve noticed how my small, everyday actions—like sticking to a study schedule—accumulate over time to lead to better academic results. The chapters emphasized the importance of goal-setting and surrounding yourself with positive influences, something I plan to apply by staying focused on my academic goals and choosing study partners who are as committed as I am.

        <h3>My Degree</h3>
        <p>
            I am currently working towards a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. This degree not only aligns with my love for technology but also positions me for a career in software development, a field that I am passionate about.

        <h3>Skills Acquired</h3>
        <p>
            The top two skills I have acquired so far are problem-solving and programming. The problem-solving skills come from tackling challenging coding problems and understanding complex algorithms. Programming, on the other hand, is a practical skill I’ve developed through working on projects in various programming languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript. These skills will be crucial as I move forward in my studies and career.
